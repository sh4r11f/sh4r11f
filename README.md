Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Sharif!

I have a Ph.D. in Cognitive Neuroscience and am currently a postdoc at Stanford University School of Medicine. I use various experimental and computational methods in my research to study vision in human and non-human primates.

## ðŸ”¬ Some interesting questions

- What are the differences between population-level neuronal representations of conscious and unconscious stimuli?
- How does the visual system maintain stability in perception despite constant changes in the retinal image?
- Which neuronal mechanisms allow perceptual inference?
- How do high-level cognitive functions like attention and learning modulate the activity of the population of neurons in visual cortex?
