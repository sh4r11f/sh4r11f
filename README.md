Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm *Sharif*, a neuroscientist!

I received my PhD from Dartmouth College and currently am a Postdoctoral Scholar at Stanford School of Medicine. My research uses various experimental and computational methods to study vision in human and non-human primates.

## ðŸ”¬ Some questions that I find interesting

- What are the differences between population-level neuronal representations of conscious and unconscious stimuli?
- How does the visual system maintain stability in perception despite constant changes of the retinal image?
- Which neuronal mechanisms allow perceptual inference?
- How do high-level cognitive functions like attention and learning modulate the activity of the population of neurons in visual cortex?
